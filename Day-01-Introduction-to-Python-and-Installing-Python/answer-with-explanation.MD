# Day 1: Introduction to Python and Installing Python

This task involves installing Python and an IDE, setting up a project folder, and creating a Python file named `movie_recommendation.py` with a welcome message printed to the console.

## Step 1: Install Python

- Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
- Follow the [installation instructions](https://medium.com/@cyberdud3/day-1-of-python-mastery-series-installation-and-setup-10fff32f354c) for your operating system. If you're using Windows, make sure to check the box to add Python to your system PATH.
- Verify that Python has been installed by opening a command prompt and typing `python`. You should see the Python version number and a prompt indicating that you're in the Python shell.

## Step 2: Install an IDE

- Download and install an integrated development environment (IDE) such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) from their official websites.
- Alternatively, you can use a text editor such as [Notepad++](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/easy-guild-set-up-notepad-run-python-script-windows-jane-yates/) or [Sublime Text](https://realpython.com/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/) and run Python from the command line.
- Open your chosen IDE and create a new project folder - `movie_recommendation`.

## Step 3: Create a Python file

- Open your IDE or text editor and navigate to the project folder.
- Within the project folder, create a new Python file named `movie_recommendation.py`.
- Create a new file in the project folder and name it `movie_recommendation.py`
- Add the following code to the file to print a welcome message to the console:

    ```
    print("Welcome to the movie recommendation system!")
    ```

## Step 4: Run the Python file

- In your IDE or command prompt, navigate to the project folder where you created the `movie_recommendation.py file`.
- Run the file by typing `python movie_recommendation.py` in the command prompt, or by clicking the Run button in your IDE.
- If everything is set up correctly, you should see the welcome message printed to the console. 

That's it for Day 1! You've installed Python and an IDE, set up a project folder, created a Python file, and printed a welcome message to the console. You're now ready to move on to Day 2 and start working with variables and data types in Python.
