# Day 2 Task: Basic data types, variables, and operators

This task involves creating variables to store user's name and age, movie genres and a list of movies under each genre, and using operators to manipulate strings.

## Step 1: Create variables to store user's name and age

- Open the 'movie_recommendation.py' file in your IDE or text editor
- Create two variables to store the user's name and age:
    ```
    name = "Cyberdud3"
    age = 29
    ```
- You can replace "Cyberdud3" and 29 with user inputs later on

## Step 2: Print a personalized message to the console based on the user's name and age

- Use string formatting to print a message that includes the user's name and age:
    ```
    print("Hello {}, you are {} years old!".format(name, age))
    ```
- This will print a message like "Hello Cyberdud3, you are 29 years old!"

## Step 3: Create variables to store movie genres and a list of movies under each genre

- Create variables to store movie genres and lists of movies under each genre:
    ```
    action_movies = ["Die Hard", "Terminator", "The Matrix"]
    comedy_movies = ["The Hangover", "Bridesmaids", "Dumb and Dumber"]
    drama_movies = ["The Shawshank Redemption", "The Godfather", "The Dark Knight"]
    ```
- You can add more genres and movies later on

## Step 4: Use operators such as + and * to manipulate strings

- Use the + operator to concatenate strings:
    ```
    print("My favorite action movie is " + action_movies[0])
    ```
- This will print a message like "My favorite action movie is Die Hard"
- Use the * operator to repeat a string:

    ```
    print("+" * 10)
    ```
- This will print ten plus signs, like "++++++++++"
 
If everything is set up correctly, you should see personalized messages and movie recommendations printed to the console.

### This marks the completion of Day 2 task.
